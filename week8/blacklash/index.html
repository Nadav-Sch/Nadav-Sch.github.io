      <strong>BlackLash (1998)</strong> is an interactive web game created by the British art collective 
      <strong>Mongrel</strong>. Built as a parody of the 1990s arcade game <em>MacAttack</em>, 
      <strong>BlackLash</strong> uses familiar video game mechanics to critique racism, class, and digital exclusion. 
      Rather than focusing on entertainment, it invites players to confront stereotypes and systems of discrimination through humor and provocation.

      Released during a time when the internet was rapidly expanding, <strong>BlackLash</strong> challenged who had 
      access to digital spaces and whose stories were represented online. By combining lo-fi graphics, 
      hip-hop sound clips, and confrontational imagery, Mongrel turned gameplay into social commentary, forcing players 
      to question how race and identity are coded into digital culture.

          <h1>The Medium is the Massage Reading Response</h1>
          <p>
            In The Medium is the Massage, Marshall McLuhan explains that the form or medium through which we receive information is often more important than the message itself. He argues that new technologies like television, radio, and print don’t just deliver content, they actually shape how we think, behave, and understand the world. Reading this made me realize how much our modern media, such as social media and smartphones, affect the way we communicate and see reality. It’s not just about what we read or watch, but how those platforms change our attention, habits, and even relationships. McLuhan’s idea that “the medium is the message” shows that technology is never neutral, it always changes us and the way we experience the world.

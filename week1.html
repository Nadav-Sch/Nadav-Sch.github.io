        "As We May Think" by Vannevar Bush talks about how science could be used to improve human knowledge after World War II. He imagines a future where we can store and find information quickly and easily. His idea of the 'memex' which is a machine he made up that links ideas together feels a lot like today’s computers and the internet. What stood out to me is that Bush didn’t want machines to think for us. Instead, he wanted them to help us think better and handle the huge amount of information we deal with. I was surprised by how much he predicted about things we use today, like links between pages and voice commands. This essay made me think about how much we depend on technology now. Bush seemed very hopeful about technology’s role in helping people, and I agree with him, but I also think we have to be more careful about problems like misinformation. Overall, it made me appreciate how far we’ve come and how his ideas shaped the tools we use every day.
